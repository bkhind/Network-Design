# Network-Design
<h2>Scenario: </h2>
CETPA pharmaceutical company which is a subsidiary company of CETPA IT solutions is building a new pharmaceutical centre in Barwa commercial avenue, Doha, Qatar due to high demand for influenza treatment and testing. The centre includes modern equipped vaccination and testing labs. The new centre LAN (Local area Network) will incorporate 5 units: Head office (10 computer), packing and assembling (5 computers), sales (5computers), marketing (6computers), Influenza vaccination and testing lab (10 computers), 3 printers.

Building:03 floors, all computers and printers are on the ground floor apart from the IT labs- one lab located on the first floor and another located on the second floor.

You recently hired by Cetpa IT solutions. The project manager has asked you to help to plan and design the network infrastructure to meet the specific business requirement of new centre using packet tracer and or/ any software tool of your choice. The network Infrastructure should include switches, routers, wireless routers, cables, servers, printers and other network devices.

<h3>Network requirements: </h3>

-	36 computers 
-	3 printers 
-	Scalable network 
-	Reliable 
-	High traffic
  
Based on the topology analysis and the network requirements, a tree topology is used to design the CETPA network infrastructure. And thatâ€™s due to several reasons:

-	Tree topology offers scalability by allowing effortless addition of new nodes to the network as an organization grows. This makes it a great choice for accommodating network expansion as the organization expands in size.
-	The hierarchical structure of the tree topology ensures that if one node fails it won't affect the network. This provides a level of reliability, which is especially useful for maintaining network stability and uninterrupted operations.
-	The tree topology simplifies maintenance and fault identification making troubleshooting and addressing network performance issues more straightforward throughout the structure. This can lead to network management and reduced downtime.
-	Multiple hardware and software vendors support the tree topology ensuring integration with various network equipment and management tools.
-	The tree topology is renowned for its level of security making it well suited for environments where data security is a top priority, such as Wide Area Networks (WANs).

While there, are advantages to using the tree topology it's important to consider drawbacks. However, in instances the advantages of scalability, dependability and ease of upkeep render the tree topology an appealing option, for designing and managing networks.

Even though the installation is expensive, however, it is needed to bring to the company more competitive advantages. And as we have two IT labs building good network infrastructure is needed.
